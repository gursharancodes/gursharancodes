# Gursharan Singh / GursharanCodes
**Frontend Developer**

Building modern, scalable, and accessible web applications with a focus on clarity, performance, and real-world problem-solving. I specialize in turning designs and ideas into responsive, component-driven interfaces using React, Tailwind CSS, and modern frontend tooling.

### 🧭 About Me  
I engineer digital experiences that bridge the gap between design and code. With a background in building product-style UIs and client-ready systems, I aim to deliver web applications that are visually refined, structurally scalable, and optimized for user flow and maintainability.

Currently working on projects that simulate SaaS dashboards, cloud-integrated forms, and domain-specific platforms in healthcare, manufacturing, and productivity.
